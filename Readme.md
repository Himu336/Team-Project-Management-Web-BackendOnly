## 🔍 Technical Details

### Role-Based Access Control

The system uses a role-based access control mechanism to manage permissions for different user roles. The roles include OWNER, ADMIN, and MEMBER, each with specific permissions.

### Workspace and Project Management

Workspaces and projects are managed using Mongoose models. The `WorkspaceModel` and `ProjectModel` define the schema for workspaces and projects, respectively.

### Task Management

Tasks are managed using the `TaskModel`, which includes fields for task code, title, description, project, workspace, status, priority, and assigned user.

### Authentication

User authentication is handled using Passport.js, with support for both Google OAuth and local login strategies.

### Validation

The application uses Zod for schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
